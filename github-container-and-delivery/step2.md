# Creating a git repository

Now that we have a working application inside our container let's continue. Before we can upload it, we first need to create a GitHub repository. GitHub has a so called container store where you can upload your container images. This is called ghcr.io. But before we can upload anything to here, we first need to create a repository.

To link this properly you need to do the following:

1. Within the `server` folder initialize a git repository by running the following command:

```bash
git init
```

2. Commit the changes and publish it to a new repository on GitHub.

When the code is uploaded, we're ready to proceed!
